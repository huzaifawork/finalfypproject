# ========================================
# TABLE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM
# Complete Implementation Guide
# ========================================

## üìã OVERVIEW
This guide provides a complete table recommendation system implementation using machine learning.
The system includes:
- Synthetic dataset generation (50 tables, 1000 users, 15K bookings, 25K interactions)
- Collaborative Filtering using Matrix Factorization (SVD)
- Content-Based Filtering using Feature Similarity
- Hybrid System combining all approaches
- Context-Aware recommendations (occasion, time, party size)
- Performance evaluation and metrics

## üìÅ FILE STRUCTURE
1. table_recommendation_colab.txt - Main dataset generation (Cells 1-6)
2. table_recommendation_algorithms.txt - ML algorithms (Cells 7-10)
3. table_recommendation_hybrid_system.txt - Hybrid system & evaluation (Cells 11-12)

## üöÄ GOOGLE COLAB IMPLEMENTATION STEPS

### STEP 1: Setup & Dataset Generation
1. Open Google Colab (colab.research.google.com)
2. Create new notebook: "Table Recommendation System"
3. Copy and run cells 1-6 from table_recommendation_colab.txt
4. This will generate 4 CSV files:
   - tables_dataset.csv (50 tables with features)
   - users_dataset.csv (1000 users with preferences)
   - bookings_dataset.csv (15K booking records)
   - interactions_dataset.csv (25K user interactions)

### STEP 2: Data Analysis & Feature Engineering
1. Copy and run cells 7-8 from table_recommendation_algorithms.txt
2. This will:
   - Create comprehensive data visualizations
   - Engineer features for ML models
   - Create user-table interaction matrices
   - Prepare data for recommendation algorithms

### STEP 3: Machine Learning Models
1. Copy and run cells 9-10 from table_recommendation_algorithms.txt
2. This implements:
   - Collaborative Filtering (SVD-based matrix factorization)
   - Content-Based Filtering (feature similarity)
   - Individual model testing and validation

### STEP 4: Hybrid System & Evaluation
1. Copy and run cells 11-12 from table_recommendation_hybrid_system.txt
2. This provides:
   - Hybrid recommendation system (CF + CB + Popularity)
   - Context-aware recommendations
   - Explanation generation
   - Performance evaluation metrics
   - Model comparison and visualization

## üéØ RECOMMENDATION ALGORITHMS

### 1. Collaborative Filtering (40% weight)
- Algorithm: Truncated SVD (Matrix Factorization)
- Features: User-table interaction matrix with weighted scores
- Strengths: Discovers hidden patterns, works well for active users
- Handles: Cold start with popularity fallback

### 2. Content-Based Filtering (35% weight)
- Algorithm: Cosine similarity on scaled features
- Features: User preferences + Table characteristics
- Strengths: Works for new users, explainable recommendations
- Handles: Feature mapping between user preferences and table attributes

### 3. Popularity-Based (25% weight)
- Algorithm: Interaction frequency scoring
- Features: Total interaction counts per table
- Strengths: Reliable baseline, handles cold start
- Handles: Trending and generally appealing tables

### 4. Context-Aware Adjustments
- Occasion matching (Romantic ‚Üí Intimate tables)
- Time-based preferences (Lunch ‚Üí Window tables)
- Group size optimization (Party size ‚Üî Table capacity)
- Special requirements (Accessibility, Privacy, Window view)

## üìà EVALUATION METRICS

### Performance Metrics
- Precision: Relevant recommendations / Total recommendations
- Recall: Relevant recommendations / Total relevant items
- F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- Coverage: Percentage of users receiving recommendations

### Business Metrics
- Diversity: Non-popular table recommendation ratio
- Novelty: Recommendations outside user's typical preferences
- Serendipity: Surprising but relevant recommendations

## üîß CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS

### Algorithm Weights
```python
# Adjust hybrid weights based on your needs
hybrid_recommender = HybridTableRecommender(
    cf_weight=0.4,      # Collaborative filtering
    cb_weight=0.35,     # Content-based filtering  
    popularity_weight=0.25  # Popularity-based
)
```

### Context Parameters
```python
# Customize context-aware adjustments
context = {
    'occasion': 'Romantic',     # Romantic, Business, Family, Friends, Celebration, Casual
    'party_size': 2,            # Number of people
    'time_slot': 'Prime Dinner', # Lunch, Early Dinner, Prime Dinner, Late Dinner
    'prefers_window': True,     # Boolean preferences
    'prefers_private': False,
    'accessibility_needed': False
}
```

### Feature Engineering

- Include seasonal preferences (outdoor tables in summer)
- Add dietary restrictions matching
- Include price sensitivity scoring

## üíæ DATASET UPLOAD STRATEGY

1. Run dataset generation locally
2. Upload CSV files to Colab using:
```python
from google.colab import files
uploaded = files.upload()
```
3. Load datasets:
```python
tables_df = pd.read_csv('tables_dataset.csv')
users_df = pd.read_csv('users_dataset.csv')
bookings_df = pd.read_csv('bookings_dataset.csv')
interactions_df = pd.read_csv('interactions_dataset.csv')
```

### Option 3: Google Drive Integration
1. Mount Google Drive in Colab
2. Save/load datasets from Drive
3. Persistent storage across sessions
